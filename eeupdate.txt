OVERVIEW
========
EEUpdate is the EEPROM Update Utility.  Allows manufacturing programming of
EEPROMs, in cases where EEPROM is not preprogrammed, or programmed
at In-circuit test.


RUNNING THE UTILITY
===================
Using the "/?" option will display a list of supported command line options.

NOTE: EEPROM checksums and CRCs are automatically updated with any
      command that modifies the EEPROM contents.

  /IDFLASH
     Displays the flash ID and its protected status.

  /INVMGET
     Dumps the contents of the INVM to the file <mac_address>_otp, where 
     <mac_address> is the MAC address of the adapter.

  /INVMISLOCKED
     Checks if data stored in the INVM is protected against write attempts. 

  /INVMLOCK [/FORCE]
     Locks the data stored in the INVM against all future write attempts. 
     This option requires user confirmation. Using /FORCE when calling 
     INVMLOCK from a script will not display the confirmation and will not 
     cause the script to stop.

  /INVMTEST /FILE=<config_file>
     Compares the free space in the INVM to the data contained in <config_file>. 
     Returns the free space that would remain if the <config_file> were applied.

     defined in the <config_file> file. Returns the differences and displays 
     them on screen.

  /INVMVERSION
     Displays the INVM version information. A value of "00.0-0" indicates an 
     empty or invalid version. "Unsupported" indicates the device does not 
     support INVM.

  /KEEPCONFIG
     Preserves some user data during an EEPROM upgrade. Preserved data includes 
     the device's Alternate MAC Address and PXE configuration words, however 
     the preserved data depends on the device.

  /NIC=XX
     Selects a specific adapter (1-32).

  /NOPROT
     When programming an image for devices that support NVM protection,
     prevents protection from being enabled.  This switch must be used
     with the /DATA command and has no effect on NVM devices that are
     already protected.

  /PCIINFO
     Displays the PCI information of the adapter.

  /PF_MAC=macaddr /NUM=PF_num

BASIC USAGE GUIDELINES
----------------------
To display a list of installed adapters call EEUPDATE without any parameters 
as follows:

EEUPDATE

EEUPDATE will display a list of network adapters installed in the
system similar to the following:

    [EEUPDATE ver 5.0.1.0] - Intel PCI NIC EEPROM Utility
    Copyright (C) 1995 - 2004 Intel Corporation
    Intel (R) Confidential and not for general distribution.

    Warning: No Adapter Selected

    NIC Bus Dev Fun Vendor-Device  Branding string
    === === === === ============= =================================================
    1  1   00  00   8086-1008     Intel(R) PRO/1000 XT Server Adapter
    2  1   08  00   8086-1039     Intel(R) PRO/100 VE Network Connection


To perform an operation on an installed network adapter you must specify
the "/NIC=" parameter.  For example, to perform an EEPROM dump on NIC 3
from the list above call EEUPDATE like this:

EEUPDATE /NIC=3 /DUMP

Alternatively you may specify the "/BUS=" and "/DEV=" parameters instead of the
"/NIC=" parameter to specify which network adapter to select.  For example
to program NIC 1 from the list above with the EEPROM image file "image.eep"
call EEUPDATE.EXE as follows:

EEUPDATE /BUS=0 /DEV=0 /DATA image.eep


EEPROM IMAGE FILE FORMAT
------------------------
The <imagefile> parameter designates either a text file or a binary file. The
text file contains hexadecimal values with which to program the EEPROM.  Each 
value should consist of up to four hex digits separated by a space or newline.  
The data contained in <imagefile> must be formatted the same as the EEPROM 
imagefile produced by the "/dump" parameter.  An imagefile produced by the 
"/dump" parameter may be used to program the EEPROM. Comments may be added 
to the EEPROM image file as long as they are preceded by a semicolon ';'. 

Binary files are also accepted for NVM updates. A binary file can be either 
signed (used in secure mode) or unsigned.

NOTE: When programming the EEPROM using the "/DATA" parameter, EEupdate will 
      ignore the MAC Address (first 6 bytes), and EEPROM checksum (last 2 bytes). 
      However, the MAC Address and checksum locations in the EEPROM image file 
      must be filled with valid hexadecimal values.


EEPROM/NVM VERIFICATION
-----------------------
The EEPROM or NVM can be verified against an image file.
 
On devices that support EEPROM images, the following are verified:
 - DeviceID
 - EEPROM version
 - EEPROM checksum
 - VendorID (if it exists).

On devices that support NVM images, all modules are verified except the Shadow 
RAM. 

For the I210 adapter family, the Shadow RAM is verified except for the 
following:
  - MAC address
  - FW pointers and size
  - Flash Device Size
  - Validity and Protected Fields
  - PXE settings (Setup Options and Configuration Customization Options)
  - Checksum
  - OEM VPD area
  - PXE Alternate MAC Address


INVM FILE FORMAT
----------------
The <config_file> is a text file that stores sets of configuration entries and their 
values. These pairs are used to program the INVM with options such as MAC address, 
LEDs configuration, device ID and WoL behavior. Values can be changed only if the 
INVM has enough free locations available and write protection has not been applied. 

File syntax:
 Single record entry:
   <Record type> <Address> = <Data> <Reset type> <Comment>

 Ordered section:
   Ordered_Section_Start
   <Single record entry #1>
 	.
	.
   <Single record entry #N>
 Ordered_Section_End

 where:
  <Record type> - record type:
    WALD - autoload word record
    CSRALD - CSR autoload record
    PHYALD - PHY autoload record
  <Address> - address in the range of: 
    0x0000 - 0x07FF in WALD records definition
    0x00000 - 0x1FFFF in CSRALD records definition
    0x00000 - 0x1F in PHYALD records definition
  <Data> - Data to set:
    0x0000 - 0xFFFF in WALD and PHYALD records definition
    0x00000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF in CSRALD records definition
  <Reset type> - Describes the set of reset events for which the setting is applied:
    LPG_RST - LanPower Good Reset only
    PCIE_RST - PCIe asserted reset and all above
    SW_RST - Host software asserted device reset and all above (must be set for PHYALD)
  <Comment> - Alphanumeric comment (including space and tab) starting with ';'


MAC ADDRESS FILE FORMAT
-----------------------
The <addrfile> parameter designates a text file which contains MAC addresses 
to be programmed to the NIC.  This file should contain a list of one or more 
legal MAC addresses, one per line.  Each MAC address contains exactly 12 
hexadecimal digits:

Example:

000AC45D7800
000AC45D7801
000AC45D7802

A special "count" syntax may also be used. When a decimal integer in square 
brackets follows the mac address on the line, it is interpreted as a count of 
consecutive MAC addresses to be programmed.

Example:

000AC45D7800 [3]

The two examples above are the same.  Both represent three consecutive MAC 
addresses starting at 000AC45D7800.

Note: Every line in the address file must end with a carriage return.

When EEUPDATE is executed with the <addrfile>, it will sequentially program
each selected NIC with MAC addresses from the address file, starting with
the first entry.  A file, EELOG.DAT, is generated with a record of which
MAC addresses were used and which remain available.

To program the remaining MAC addresses, EEUPDATE must be run again with the 
EELOG.DAT specified for the <addrfile>.  This is necessary because only 
EELOG.DAT contains the information on which MAC addresses have been programmed 
and which still remain available.

Alternatively, the EELOG.DAT file may be copied over to the previous address 
file to eliminate the possibility of MAC Address reuse.
(See Example 1 and 2).

If EEUPDATE is run again using the same address file (without copying
EELOG.DAT), it will program MAC addresses starting back at the first entry
in the address file.  Please use caution to always use the EELOG.DAT file in
order to not program two different NIC ports with the same MAC address.

Dual port adapters:
When programming the MAC address and EEPROM from a file on a dual port adapter,
the recommended method to only select the 1st port of the dual port adapter
for programming.  The MAC address file should therefore contain only the 1st
port MAC addresses.  This method is more efficient, as the EEPROM is only
programmed once.

82580, 82598, 82599 adapters:
These adapters require per port MAC address programming.  Each port of the
adapter must be selected and the desired MAC address programmed on each port.
When programming the EEPROM image, only one port needs to be selected in
order to program the EEPROM image file.
(See Example 9)


EELOG.DAT
---------
When <addrfile> is used as a source for MAC addresses, EEUPDATE generates 
a file named EELOG.DAT which contains a record of which MAC addresses in 
<addrfile> were used and which remain available. Those addresses used are 
tagged with a date/time stamp like this:

000AC45D7800 : 10:43:14  08/30/2000

The file format for EELOG.DAT is readable as input for <addrfile> in 
future invocations of EEUPDATE.  As of EEUPDATE 3.27, the EELOG.DAT file 
may be used as both input and output simultaneously.


EXAMPLES
--------
Example 1:
To update the EEPROM and MAC Address with the data stored in the files 
imagefile.eep and addrfile.dat respectively, call EEUPDATE like this:
   STEP1: EEUPDATE /NIC=1 /D imagefile.eep /A addrfile.dat
   STEP2: copy eelog.dat addrfile.dat

Example 2:
To update the MAC Address on the third Intel network adapter found in your
system without changing the rest of the EEPROM, call EEUPDATE like this:
   STEP1: EEUPDATE /NIC=3 /A addrfile.dat
   STEP2: copy eelog.dat addrfile.dat

Example 3:
To update the EEPROM on all of the Intel network adapters with device 
ID 2449, without changing the MAC address, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /DEVICE=2449 /D imagefile.eep

Example 4:
To dump the EEPROM contents on all of the Intel network adapters in your 
system, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /ALL /DUMP

Example 5:
To clear specific bit 1 in word 0xA in the EEPROM on all of the Intel 
network adapters in your system with device ID 1038, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /DEVICE=1038 /CB 0xA 0x2

Example 6:
To set bit 1 in word 0xA in the EEPROM on all of the Intel network 
adapters in your system, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /ALL /SB 0xA 0x2

Example 7:
To read word 0x9 from the EEPROM, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /NIC=3 /RW 0x9

Example 8:
To write word 0x9 to the EEPROM on the third Intel network adapter found 
in your system, and update its checksum, call EEUPDATE like this:
   EEUPDATE /NIC=3 /WW 0x9 0x1234

Example 9:
To update the EEPROM and MAC Address for a dual-port adapter that requires
per port MAC address programming, call EEUPDATE like this:
    STEP1:  EEUPDATE /NIC=1 /D imagefile.eep /A eelog.dat
    STEP2:  EEUPDATE /NIC=2 /A eelog.dat

Example 10:
To update the MAC Address for a multi function per port adapter that
requires per function MAC address programming, call EEUPDATE like this:
    EEUPDATE /NIC=1 /NUM=1 /PF_MAC=macaddr
or
    EEUPDATE /NIC=1 /NUM=1 /MAC=macaddr

NOTES
-----

* If you run EEUPDATE without any command line options, EEUPDATE will   display 
  a listing of all of the supported Intel Network adapters found in your system.

* When using the '/dump' command, EEUPDATE will automatically create a file and 
  name it, based on the last 8 bytes of your Intel Network adapter's MAC Address. 
  For example, if your MAC Address was '00AA11223344', EEUPDATE would create the 
  file called '11223344.EEP'.

* Both <word> and <bitmask> parameters *must* be sent to eeupdate in hexadecimal.

* The EEPROM Checksums and CRCs are automatically updated when you clear/set a 
  bit or bits, and when you write a word to the EEPROM.

ERROR CODES:
-------------
EEUPDATE returns error codes to the command line.  A description of each of these 
codes can be found in the tool by running eeupdate /exitcodes.

Installation
=============

INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON MICROSOFT* WINDOWS*
===========================================
The tools driver can be installed on all versions of Microsoft* Windows* since 
Windows 7. To install the tools' drivers on Windows, run install.bat from the 
appropriate directory on the CD.   

Although the tools are not installed with install.bat, the driver that the tools 
require is copied into the local machine Windows driver directory. To run the 
tools, launch a Command Prompt window from the Windows Start Menu. Go to the 
media and directory where the tools are located and run the tools. The readme 
files for each tool are found in the same directory as the tools. These tools 
can be manually installed on the local hard drive in any directory.

The tool uses its own driver file (not the same as the system network driver).
If the driver sys file already exists in the drivers directory, install.bat may
fail to copy. Using the /y switch with install.bat will override and copy the 
driver file regardless. However, this can be dangerous if an older version of 
the driver is being used by another application such as Intel(R) PROSet for Windows
Device Manager. If a driver is already present in the drivers directory, try 
running the tool from the command prompt. If it runs, then the driver is fine. 
The tool will not run if the driver version present does not match the driver 
version expected.

Note that for Windows 7 (and later), the user must have access to the 
%systemroot%\system32\drivers directory. Only the administrator account has these
privileges. The user must be logged in as administrator or the tools must be 
"run as" administrator.

Note that on Windows, any device that is disabled in device manager will not be
accessible by tools due to no memory resources. You would get an error code 0xC86A800E.
To solve this problem, you can do one of the following:
1) Re-enable the device in device manager. Never disable this device when using tools.
2) Install an NDIS device driver for the device and make sure that it does not have
   a yellow or red bang by it in device manager.
3) Delete the device from device manager and restart the system. The install new 
   hardware wizard should appear on next reboot. Do not cancel this. Just move the
   window aside and run the tool(s). Generally, you can click "cancel" on the wizard
   but there are some cases where Windows will disable the memory resources causing
   you to get back into the same state.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON EFI
==============================
There is no installation required for EFI tools. The tools can simply be copied 
from the appropriate directory to the drive that they will run from. The EFI2 
binaries are for use with the UEFI Shell 2.X with the UEFI 2.3 HII protocol. 
EFI2 tools will not run on the EFI Shell 1.X or if the UEFI 2.3 HII protocol is 
not present.

Note that while EFI supports USB drives, there may be issues running tools from the USB
drive. Whether or not there are issues are BIOS specific. If issues are experienced,
the tool should be run from hard disk instead.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON DOS
===========================
The tools support various DOS versions.  There is no installation required for 
DOS tools. The tools can simply be copied from the DOS directory on the CD to the drive
that they will run from.  It is expected that the tools have a clean boot environment. 
The tools will not run with memory managers and/or DOS networking drivers loaded. 
The tools expect that they have full, unlimited control of the hardware. The tools 
*WILL NOT* run properly if EMM386 is present.  The tools run in protected mode, 32-bit
DOS. Therefore, they will not be compatible with any TSR programs.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON LINUX*
==============================
In order to run tools on Linux*, a driver stub must be built and installed on 
the system. This driver is not related to the network device driver that is 
used to run the network during live traffic. It is a separate driver used 
explicitly for tools. Due to the nature of Linux with the number of kernels 
that can exist, we provide source for the driver module and an install script 
to build/install it.

The tools support Linux distributions based on kernels 2.6.x. Validation is done 
randomly on popular distributions such as Red Hat* or Suse*. Configured 
kernel source that matches the currently installed kernel is required. A working 
GCC is also required. There are some versions of GCC that had a bug which did not 
support unnamed structures. These versions of GCC are not supported. If you have 
compilation errors, try updating your version of GCC.  If you have linker errors 
when installing the driver, you should update your kernel - download the latest 
stable off www.kernel.org and build/install it.

Note that some distributions such as recent Fedora core versions do not ship with Kernel 
source. You must download, install, and configure the source in order to get the tools' 
driver built on this OS. Installing the kernel source RPM does not solve the problem.

This is the installation procedure:

    1. Log in as root and create a temporary directory to build the Intel(R)
       Network Connection Tools driver.

    2. Copy ‘install’ and ‘iqvlinux.tar.gz’ to the temporary directory.
       There are 3 versions of Linux supported: Linux32 (x86), Linux64e (x64),
       and Linux64 (Itanium). Copies of the above files exist in the appropriate
       directory for your platform.

    3. CD to the temporary directory and run ‘./install.’  The driver has been
       installed now, so the files in the temporary directory can be removed. 

    4. Copy the tools that you want to use from the appropriate directory of the CD.


INSTALLING THE TOOLS ON ORACLE* SOLARIS*
========================================
Iqvsolaris is a separate driver used explicitly for tools and is provided only in 
binary form. Iqvsolaris driver and tools are provided for 2 different architectures: 
64s for sparc and 64e for x86_64. 

In order to run tools on Solaris*, peform the following steps:

  1. Log in as root.

  2. Manually unload the network device driver.

  3. Copy the binary iqv driver to the local machine driver directory by 
     running the ‘./install’ script.
